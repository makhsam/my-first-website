<p style="font-size:170%"><ins> Our meetings have 2 parts:</ins>
<ol style="font-size:170%">
  <li>
 <b>Prepared speeches:</b> Members learn communication skills by working in the Competent Communication manual,
 a series of 10 self-paced speaking assignments designed to instil a basic foundation in public speaking.
 Participants learn skills related to use of humour, gestures, eye contact, speech organization and overall delivery. When finished with this manual, members can choose from 15 advanced manuals to learn skills related to specific interests (Public Relations, Storytelling, Humorously Speaking, etc...).
  </li>
  <li>
<b>Table topics:</b> The Table Topics portion of our meetings takes place after the formal "prepared speeches" segment and usually lasts 20 or 30 minutes. 
The Topicsmaster announces a topic or question and calls on several members, one at a time, who give impromptu one-to-two-minute responses to that topic.
